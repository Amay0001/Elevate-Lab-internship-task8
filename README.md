VPN Setup and Connection Report

This README provides a human-friendly guide and documentation of setting up and using a free VPN service (ProtonVPN), including verification of connection status with screenshots, and a summary of VPN benefits and limitations.

Why Use a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your Internet connection, keeping your online activity private and secure. It hides your real IP address by routing your traffic through a remote VPN server, helping you browse anonymously and securely, especially on public Wi-Fi or geo-restricted sites.


 Step-by-Step VPN Setup Guide

1. Choose and Sign Up  
I chose **ProtonVPN**, a reliable and well-regarded free VPN provider known for strong privacy policies and no user logs. Signing up involved creating an account on their official website.

2. Download and Install  
Downloaded the ProtonVPN client for Windows from the official downloads page. Installation was simple and followed the standard wizard steps.

3. Connect to a VPN Server  
Logged in through the client and selected a free server located in Romania (RO-FREE#23). The app also suggests fast servers automatically, enhancing connection quality.

4. Verify IP Address Change  
Before connection, my IP address was `223.237.172.12`, located in India. After connecting, the IP changed to the VPN server’s IP (`146.70.246.109` in Australia for this connection), confirming that my real IP was hidden.

5. Browse and Confirm Encryption  
The VPN encrypted my browsing traffic via the WireGuard (UDP) protocol. The client’s interface confirmed active features like Kill Switch and NetShield, adding security against leaks and malware.

6. Disconnect and Compare Speed  
Disconnecting reverted my IP to the original ISP-assigned address, and browsing speed normalized. While connected, speeds were slightly reduced due to encryption overhead, which is expected.

7. Research VPN Encryption and Privacy  
ProtonVPN uses modern encryption protocols (WireGuard/OpenVPN) ensuring strong security. Its no-logs policy ensures browsing activities are not recorded. Features like Kill Switch prevent data leaks if the VPN disconnects and protect your privacy.

Benefits of Using a VPN

- Masks your real IP, adding anonymity online.  
- Encrypts data, protecting sensitive information, especially on public Wi-Fi.  
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and access content worldwide.  
- Adds layers of privacy and security controls like kill switches and malware blockers.

Limitations of Free VPNs

- Free servers often have limited speeds and server locations.  
- VPN encryption can slow down your browsing due to extra data processing.  
- Trust is placed in the VPN provider’s privacy policies and technical safeguards.  
- Some features are reserved for paid versions.
